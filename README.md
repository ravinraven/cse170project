There are several "bugs" in the application which is now considered fully functioning "feature" of the application.
Thus the development of this application is as complete as it will get. 

Since this is meant to be a mobile web app, there are several limitations the app, include the miriads of devices capable of running
the application through browsers, the application may not be functioning correctly in all platforms. The code was mainly tested for
Chrome on iOS 7, Safari, Chrome, and Firefox on Mac OSX, and Chrome on Android.
